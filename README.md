## Notes
1. This project mainly writes configuration files and fragments for Clash.Meta. New features of the Meta kernel will be adapted and supported more quickly. To reduce compatibility issues, please prioritize using the latest version of the Meta kernel.
2. Due to limited personal resources, no commitment is made to the compatibility, maintenance, and timeliness of Loon, Surfboard, and Quantumult X.

## User Guide
1. The Clash.Meta configuration files are located in the config folder, including route.yaml, normal.yaml, and phone.yaml, which correspond to the routing version, computer (or other) version, and mobile version, respectively. Different versions will make adjustments and optimizations for the corresponding usage environment (mixing is not prohibited).
2. The Quantumult X configuration file is temporarily suspended (2023).
3. The Surfboard configuration file will be occasionally maintained (low playability).
4. The Loon configuration file will be updated and maintained at a low frequency.
